Here's a README file structure for your project, incorporating the additional information on data sources and a high-level overview of the setup steps. This README is designed to guide users through setting up a scalable ingestion and embedding pipeline using Apache Spark, Milvus, and LLMs with a simple Gradio interface for querying.

# Scalable Data Ingestion and Embedding Pipeline with Apache Spark, Milvus, and LLMs

This project provides a robust architecture to process and embed large sets of enterprise documents (such as PDFs, DOCs, HTML, images) into a vector database for scalable retrieval. Using tools like Apache Spark, Milvus, and various large language models (LLMs), it enables efficient and scalable data processing to answer queries based on vast document repositories.

## Features

- **Data Sources**: Scrapes content from websites, GitHub, Wikipedia, PDFs, DOC files, and more.
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts and converts data into PDFs for consistency.
- **Data Processing**: Uses Apache Spark with UDFs for scalable extraction, splitting, and embedding.
- **Embeddings**: Supports embeddings using `all-MiniLM-L12-v2` from the Hugging Face `sentence-transformer` library.
- **Vector Database**: Utilizes Milvus for storing embeddings, with support for other vector databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, and ElasticSearch.
- **LLMs**: Demonstrates query answering using OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Llama2–13B.
- **User Interface**: Provides a Gradio-based UI for simple querying, customizable with other libraries like Streamlit.

## Architecture Overview

This pipeline architecture supports end-to-end document ingestion, processing, and embedding for efficient information retrieval. 

### Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Scrape data from various sources, save in PDF format.
2. **Data Loading**: Save raw and transformed data to an S3 bucket.
3. **Data Processing**: Use Apache Spark for scalable extraction, splitting, and embedding of document chunks.
4. **Embedding Storage**: Store embeddings in Milvus (or an alternative vector database).
5. **LLM Querying**: Utilize OpenAI's ChatGPT or Llama2 for generating answers based on retrieved embeddings.
6. **User Interface**: Query using a Gradio interface.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

---

## Requirements

- **Python** (3.7+)
- **Docker** (for running Milvus)
- **Apache Spark**
- **Milvus Vector Database**
- **Gradio** (for query UI)
- Libraries: `sentence-transformers`, `pymilvus`, `openai`, `replicate`

Refer to `requirements.txt` for a complete list of required libraries.

## Setup and Installation

### Step 1: Set Up Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Launch Milvus Vector Database

Use Docker to set up and run Milvus:

```bash
docker pull milvusdb/milvus
docker run -d --name milvus -p 19530:19530 milvusdb/milvus
```

### Step 3: Apache Spark Setup

Install and configure Apache Spark. You may use a single-node setup for testing.

### Step 4: Embedding and Query Setup

Install the necessary libraries for embedding and query handling:

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers pymilvus openai replicate gradio
```

---

## Usage

1. **Data Extraction**: Scrape and save data in PDF format. Convert other formats (DOC, HTML) as needed.
2. **Run Processing**: Use Spark with UDFs for extraction, chunking, and embedding.
3. **Store in Milvus**: Store embeddings in Milvus or your preferred vector database.
4. **Query Interface**: Run Gradio interface for querying with OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Llama2 for response generation.

```bash
python run_pipeline.py  # Example script to initiate the entire pipeline
```

---

## Data Sources

This pipeline supports various data sources including:

- **Web scraping** from websites like GitHub and Wikipedia.
- **Documents** in formats such as PDF, DOC, HTML, and images.
  
Data is scraped and transformed as necessary, then saved to S3 for consistent processing and availability across pipeline stages.

---

## Embedding Model and Vector Database

### Embeddings

The pipeline uses `all-MiniLM-L12-v2` from the Hugging Face `sentence-transformer` library by default. You can easily switch to other models.

### Vector Database

Milvus is the default vector database used here, but the setup also supports alternatives like Pinecone, Weaviate, ElasticSearch, and MongoDB.
